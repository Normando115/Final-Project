<h1>Artist Statement</h1>
<p id="statement">
This project is based on my experience working at a restaurant as a busser. It was made to emulate an buser at a restaurant and what you should and should not do.
 The goal of the game is to make sure you are making the right choices and not get fired. The reason I chose
  to make a game about my experience at a restaurant is because it was
where this or that happens so I thought that I should make a game of that reality instead of actually
something I genuinely enjoyed and sometimes when I worked there, I would imagine these scenarios
doing some of these things that could get my boss angry. I hope you enjoy the game and the unique endings and scenarios that it holds.
